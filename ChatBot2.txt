{{ LLM  | prompt: "Your **ONLY** output must be a single JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanation, or conversational filler outside of the required JSON structure.

The JSON object **MUST** contain exactly two key-value pairs:
1.  **\"suspicious\"**: A boolean value (`true` or `false`). Set to `true` if you think the worker should report the situation to the authorities; otherwise, set to `false`.
2.  **\"response\"**: The answer to the worker's chat message based on hospital policies. Thoroughly explain the worker's question in detail if you think it needs an explanation.

**Example of the REQUIRED output format:**
{\"suspicious\": false, \"response\": \"Please ensure the patient's records are updated with the new medication.\"}
